# Not a blog, per se...

## TL;DR

I'm a person doing things I enjoy, this is my record. *doo* *doo* &#9834;&#9833;

## Explanation
I'd like to think I have a few titles: Programmer, Game Designer, Video Editor, Musician and others I'd like to claim. But, <span class="tip"><span class="text">I can't</span><span class="info">personally</span></span> claim these titles with out some sort of tangible proof of my participation. So that's where this "record" comes into play, I'm publicizing my progress in my crafts. Chances are these records won't be exclusive to tangible progress. There may be thoughts and/or rants, but <span class="tip"><span class="text">should</span><span class="info">hopefully, but not necessarily</span></span> reflect some sort of growth. I avoid labeling this as a blog because this was not created for others to hear my opinion on matters like <span class="tip"><span class="text">our society</span><span class="info">we live in one</span></span>. It's for me to gauge myself from another point of view. Like a dialog to the general public for my future self. "Then why not keep the dialog private?" Accountability, I enjoy criticism, others could find it helpful, pick one. So with that said, this <span class="tip"><span class="text">isn't a blog, per se...</span><span class="info">roll credits</span></span>, but it's pretty much a blog.
