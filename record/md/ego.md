# Ego

## Question
Is someone egotistical if they believe they are capable of making great change in the world and accept that responsibility?

<br/>

### Misconception

I have avoided being egotistical for the fear of being subjectively or objectively wrong. In my sense of morality ego is immoral. The sense of deserving or valuing one's self or actions over another’s, is wrong. In following this <span class="peek">belief<span class="peek-text"> with little thought </span></span> I have skewed my perception of accomplishment and self-worth. I devalue my accomplishments with the thought *“anyone could have achieved this and many have so it is irrelevant that I have”*. Thus devaluing my self-worth, *“I haven’t achieved anything noteworthy or exceptional so what is the point”*. I have created a non-rewarding set of expectations and goals for myself.

<br/>

### Progression

Progression in any activity or task with these expectations lacks reward leading to demoralization and demotivation. This leaves familiarity as a primary driver discouraging change and growth. I often find myself stagnant in my endeavors unable to grow and lacking the motivation to continue.

<br/>

### New Perspective

I believe I have misconstrued valuing one's self and being egotistical. Ego isn’t to value one’s self over another but an awareness of one’s self. A healthy ego requires balance. Selflessness and selfishness. Self-worth and understanding. Valuing yourself in regard to yourself not others. Understand how you, yourself, have changed over time and find motivation in your growth and your shortcomings. 

<br/>

All this simplified to say, 

<br/>

Love yourself.
