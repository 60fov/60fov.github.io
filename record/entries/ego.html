<h2>Question</h2>
<p>Is someone egotistical if they believe they are capable of making great change in the world and accept that responsibility?</p>
<br />
<h3>Misconception</h3>
<p>I have avoided being egotistical for the fear of being subjectively or objectively wrong. In my sense of morality ego is immoral. The sense of deserving or valuing one&apos;s self or actions over another’s, is wrong. In following this <span class="peek">belief<span class="peek-text"> with little thought </span></span> I have skewed my perception of accomplishment and self-worth. I devalue my accomplishments with the thought <em>&quot;anyone could have achieved this and many have so it is irrelevant that I have”</em>. Thus devaluing my self-worth, <em>“I haven’t achieved anything noteworthy or exceptional so what is the point”</em>. I have created a non-rewarding set of expectations and goals for myself.</p>
<br />
<h3>Progression</h3>
<p>Progression in any activity or task with these expectations lacks reward leading to demoralization and demotivation. This leaves familiarity as a primary driver discouraging change and growth. I often find myself stagnant in my endeavors unable to grow and lacking the motivation to continue.</p>
<br />
<h3>New Perspective</h3>
<p>I believe I have misconstrued valuing one&apos;s self and being egotistical. Ego isn’t to value one’s self over another but an awareness of one’s self. A healthy ego requires balance. Selflessness and selfishness. Self-worth and understanding. Valuing yourself in regard to yourself not others. Understand how you, yourself, have changed over time and find motivation in your growth and your shortcomings.</p>
<br />
<p>All this simplified to say,</p>
<br />
<p>Love yourself.</p>
