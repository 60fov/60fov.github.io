<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>I&apos;m a person doing things I enjoy, this is my record. <em>doo</em> <em>doo</em> ♪♩</p>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>I&apos;d like to think I have a few titles: Programmer, Game Designer, Video Editor, Musician and others I&apos;d like to claim. But, <span class="tip"><span class="text">I can&apos;t</span><span class="info">personally</span></span> claim these titles with out some sort of tangible proof of my participation. So that&apos;s where this &quot;record&quot; comes into play, I&apos;m publicizing my progress in my crafts. Chances are these records won&apos;t be exclusive to tangible progress. There may be thoughts and/or rants, but <span class="tip"><span class="text">should</span><span class="info">hopefully, but not necessarily</span></span> reflect some sort of growth. I avoid labeling this as a blog because this was not created for others to hear my opinion on matters like <span class="tip"><span class="text">our society</span><span class="info">we live in one</span></span>. It&apos;s for me to gauge myself from another point of view. Like a dialog to the general public for my future self. &quot;Then why not keep the dialog private?&quot; Accountability, I enjoy criticism, others could find it helpful, pick one. So with that said, this <span class="tip"><span class="text">isn&apos;t a blog, per se...</span><span class="info">roll credits</span></span>, but it&apos;s pretty much a blog.</p>
